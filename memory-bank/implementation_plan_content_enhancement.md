# Implementation Plan: Content Enhancement & Dynamic Features

**Parent Module(s)**: [content_module.md], [components_module.md]
**Status**: [ ] Proposed / [x] Planned / [ ] In Progress / [ ] Completed / [ ] Deferred

## 1. Objective / Goal
Enhance portfolio content with dynamic GitHub API integration, real-time project updates, and interactive user experiences while maintaining performance and accessibility standards.

## 2. Affected Components / Files
*   **Code:**
    *   `scripts/github-api.js` - GitHub API integration for real-time project data
    *   `scripts/content-manager.js` - Dynamic content loading and management
    *   `data/projects.json` - Project showcase data structure
    *   `data/skills.json` - Skills and technology data
    *   `scripts/main.js` - Enhanced interactive features
*   **Documentation:**
    *   `activeContext.md` - Current development focus and priorities
    *   `CHANGELOG.md` - Feature development history
*   **Features:**
    *   Real-time GitHub repository data
    *   Interactive project filtering and search
    *   Dynamic skill level visualization

## 3. High-Level Approach / Design Decisions
*   **Approach:** Progressive enhancement with fallback to static data for reliability
*   **Design Decisions:**
    *   GitHub API integration with rate limiting and error handling
    *   Client-side caching for improved performance
    *   Intersection Observer for smooth animations and lazy loading
    *   Accessibility-first interactive components
*   **Data Strategy:**
    *   Hybrid approach: static JSON data with GitHub API enhancement
    *   Local storage caching for API responses
    *   Graceful degradation when API is unavailable
*   **User Experience:**
    *   Smooth animations and micro-interactions
    *   Responsive design across all device sizes
    *   Fast loading with progressive content rendering

## 4. Task Decomposition (Roadmap Steps)
*   [ ] **GitHub API Integration**: Implement real-time repository data fetching with rate limiting
*   [ ] **Interactive Filtering**: Create project filtering system by technology and category
*   [ ] **Content Animation**: Add smooth scroll animations and content reveals
*   [ ] **Skill Visualization**: Implement interactive skill level displays
*   [ ] **Search Functionality**: Add project and content search capabilities
*   [ ] **Performance Testing**: Validate enhanced features maintain 90+ Lighthouse scores

## 5. Task Sequence / Build Order
1.  GitHub API Integration - *Foundation for dynamic content*
2.  Interactive Filtering - *Core functionality*
3.  Content Animation - *User experience enhancement*
4.  Skill Visualization - *Content enhancement*
5.  Search Functionality - *Advanced features*
6.  Performance Testing - *Quality validation*

## 6. Prioritization within Sequence
*   GitHub API Integration: P1 (Core Feature)
*   Interactive Filtering: P1 (User Experience)
*   Content Animation: P2 (Enhancement)
*   Skill Visualization: P2 (Content)
*   Search Functionality: P3 (Advanced)
*   Performance Testing: P1 (Quality Assurance)

## 7. Open Questions / Risks
*   GitHub API rate limiting impact on user experience
*   Content loading performance with dynamic features
*   Accessibility compliance with interactive elements
*   Offline functionality with dynamic content
