# Module: Components

## Purpose & Responsibility
The Components module manages reusable UI elements and interactive components that form the building blocks of the portfolio website. It ensures consistency, maintainability, and efficient code reuse across all sections.

## Interfaces
* `ProjectCard`: Individual project showcase component
  * `renderProject()`: Display project information with images and links
  * `toggleDetails()`: Expand/collapse project details
* `SkillBadge`: Visual skill representation
  * `displayProficiency()`: Show skill level with progress bars or icons
  * `categorizeSkills()`: Group skills by technology type
* Input: Component configuration data and user interactions
* Output: Rendered component HTML with associated styling and behavior

## Implementation Details
* Files:
  * `scripts/main.js` - âœ… Comprehensive component classes (Navigation, ContactForm, ScrollAnimations)
  * `scripts/content-manager.js` - âœ… Dynamic content rendering with GitHub integration
  * `scripts/asset-manager.js` - âœ… Professional asset management with lazy loading
  * `scripts/github-api.js` - âœ… Live repository data integration
  * `styles/components.css` - âœ… Complete component styling with animations
* Important algorithms:
  * âœ… Component lifecycle management with class-based architecture
  * âœ… Dynamic content rendering from JSON data sources
  * âœ… Event delegation with optimized performance (throttling, debouncing)
  * âœ… Intersection Observer for scroll-triggered animations
  * âœ… Asset loading optimization with caching strategies
* Data Models
  * âœ… `ContentManager`: Dynamic content loading and caching
  * âœ… `AssetManager`: Image optimization and lazy loading
  * âœ… `GitHubAPI`: Repository data fetching with rate limiting
  * âœ… `ScrollAnimations`: Advanced animation control with performance optimization

## Current Implementation Status
* âœ… Completed: 
  * Navigation component with smooth scrolling and active states
  * Contact form with validation and submission handling
  * Scroll animations with intersection observers and performance optimization
  * Content management system with dynamic loading from JSON
  * Asset management with lazy loading and WebP support
  * GitHub API integration with live repository data
  * Professional asset system (favicon, images, icons)
  * Advanced animations and micro-interactions
* ðŸ”„ In Progress: 
  * Dark mode toggle component
  * Image optimization enhancements
* ðŸ“‹ Planned:
  * Contact form backend integration
  * SEO component optimization
  * Cross-browser compatibility testing
* Pending: [All component implementation]
