# Active Context: Personal Portfolio Website

**Last Updated**: 2025-06-02
**Current Focus**: DigitalOcean Production Deployment & Auto-Deploy Configuration
**Working Session**: DigitalOcean Integration, GitHub App Setup, and Live Deployment Success
**Active Branch**: main

## Current State
- **Project Status**: DEPLOYED TO PRODUCTION - Live on DigitalOcean with auto-deploy
- **Architecture**: Fully deployed portfolio with comprehensive GitHub integration
- **Technology Stack**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript + GitHub API + DigitalOcean + Auto-Deploy
- **Development Stage**: Production live deployment with automatic GitHub integration

## Immediate Goals
1. Implement dark mode toggle with system preference detection and persistence
2. Convert images to WebP format and implement comprehensive lazy loading
3. Complete SEO optimization with meta tags, Open Graph, and structured data
4. Integrate Netlify Forms for functional contact form with validation

## Active Work Stream
**Current Task**: Phase 4 Production Deployment and Optimization
- âœ… Phase 1 Foundation Complete (Professional HTML/CSS/JS framework)
- âœ… Phase 2 Content Infrastructure Complete (JSON data system and content manager)
- âœ… Phase 3 Enhancement Complete (GitHub API, Assets, Advanced Animations)
- ðŸ”„ **In Progress**: Phase 4 Production optimization, deployment, and final polish

## Recent Accomplishments
- âœ… **DigitalOcean Production Deployment**: Successfully deployed portfolio to https://kaelen-portfolio-demo-mzedb.ondigitalocean.app
- âœ… **GitHub App Integration**: Installed and configured DigitalOcean GitHub App for seamless repository access
- âœ… **Auto-Deploy Configuration**: Set up automatic deployments on GitHub pushes with deploy_on_push: true
- âœ… **FitForge Deployment**: Successfully deployed FitForge app to https://fitforge-free-9zezd.ondigitalocean.app
- âœ… **Buildpack Resolution**: Solved Node.js buildpack detection issues for static site deployment
- âœ… **CLI Integration**: Established reliable DigitalOcean CLI workflow with authenticated API access
- âœ… **GitHub Repository Enhancement**: Enhanced with comprehensive project descriptions and workflows

## Next Steps - Post-Deployment Optimization
1. **IMMEDIATE**: Fix package.json buildpack detection for reliable auto-deploy (add package-lock.json or configure buildpack)
2. **Week 1**: Test and validate auto-deploy functionality with code changes
3. **Week 1**: Set up custom domain for DigitalOcean deployment
4. **Week 2**: Implement monitoring and analytics for production deployment
5. **Week 2**: Configure security headers and HTTPS optimization
6. **Week 3**: Performance monitoring and Lighthouse score optimization on live deployment
7. **Week 3**: Cross-browser testing on production environment


## Task Progress
- **Total Tasks**: 20
- **Completed**: 0 (0%)
- **In Progress**: 0
- **Pending**: 20
- **Current Phase**: Phase 4: Production Optimization

## Context Notes
- This is a personal portfolio website project starting from scratch
- Using modern web development practices with semantic HTML5 and responsive design
- Following accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Mobile-first development approach
- Clean, maintainable code architecture

## Decisions Made
- âœ… **Deployment Platform**: DigitalOcean App Platform for production hosting
- âœ… **Auto-Deploy Strategy**: GitHub App integration with deploy_on_push configuration  
- âœ… **CLI Workflow**: DigitalOcean CLI for reliable deployment management vs MCP servers
- âœ… **Repository Strategy**: Enhanced GitHub repository with comprehensive project descriptions
- âœ… **Buildpack Solution**: Static site deployment with temporary package.json removal approach
- Vanilla JavaScript approach (no framework) for simplicity and performance
- Component-based architecture for maintainability
- CRCT/HDTA documentation system for project organization

## Current Challenges
- **Buildpack Detection**: Auto-deploy fails when package.json is present (Node.js vs Static buildpack conflict)
- **MCP Environment Variables**: DigitalOcean MCP server has authentication issues (CLI works perfectly)
- **Auto-Deploy Reliability**: Need package-lock.json or proper buildpack configuration for consistent deployments

## Live Deployments
- **Portfolio**: https://kaelen-portfolio-demo-mzedb.ondigitalocean.app âœ… LIVE
- **FitForge**: https://fitforge-free-9zezd.ondigitalocean.app âœ… LIVE
